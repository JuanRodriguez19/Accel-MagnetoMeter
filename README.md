### Introduction

Hello and welcome to the (unofficial) build instructions and guide to using the
LSM303 Accelerometer and Magnetometer. The scope of this little project is to
learn and integrate a piece of hardware and broadcomm development platform
together. In our case, we will be using a Raspberry Pi B as our platform. All of
which can then be used for real world applications.
