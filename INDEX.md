### Progress Report:

While on track for the most part, I fell behind in week 7 slightly as most
students had their sensors soldered. I made up the gap by mock bread-boarding my
sensor and Pi over the weekend leading toward week 8. One of the problems I
encountered was finding the correct GPIO labeling for this sensor as it is not
one of the more popular devices. Another neat solution to connecting to my Pi is
via a direct ethernet cable to my laptop along with VNC. This provides a simple
and quick connection.

As for any other extra amenities required, I needed an ethernet cable to connect
the Pi directly to my laptop, which happened to be lying around. Fritzing is
almost completed for the PCB etching in week 9. In all, this project is on track
and luckily, no major road bumps have occurred as of yet.
