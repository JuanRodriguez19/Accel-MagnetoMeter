### Fritzing and PCB Update:

### Progress Report:

The schedule of the EaseOmeter is proceeding as expected, and as stated before,
I am fortunate to be not hitting any major road blocks as of yet. The fritzing
was completed on time with the help of my professor’s clarification on some
designing techniques. It was suggested to prevent any lines from crossing as
that would interfere with the PCB etching, as well as instructing us on the
proper use of via’s and differentiating the differences between the top and
bottom of the PCB. I should be able to hit the Week 10 milestone next week.

Financial status is still OK as of right now and I am currently refining and
double checking the PCB part on fritzing before send off to the lab for etching.
Ground needs to be sent around the pins still as it would conflict with the GPIO
pins in the Raspberry Pi.

### Progress Report:

While on track for the most part, I fell behind in week 7 slightly as most
students had their sensors soldered. I made up the gap by mock bread-boarding my
sensor and Pi over the weekend leading toward week 8. One of the problems I
encountered was finding the correct GPIO labeling for this sensor as it is not
one of the more popular devices. Another neat solution to connecting to my Pi is
via a direct ethernet cable to my laptop along with VNC. This provides a simple
and quick connection.

As for any other extra amenities required, I needed an ethernet cable to connect
the Pi directly to my laptop, which happened to be lying around. Fritzing is
almost completed for the PCB etching in week 9. In all, this project is on track
and luckily, no major road bumps have occurred as of yet.
